<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am from Argentina but currently live in the US. I am a fun and creative
  person who is passionate about technology. I started my Software Engineer
  career development about 5 years ago at BYU Idaho and I am thrilled to announce that I will 
  be graduating in 2026. 
  My hobbies are sewing (dresses, jackets, and other apparel clothing), working out, and playing pickleball.
  I am also practicing Chinese and Italian. I love learning other languages so every week I try to learn a little
  from a different culture and their language.
</p>

<p>I am an entrepreneur who always thinks outside the box to make my business grow. I am building my portfolio in 
  web development and preparing myself to apply to the Software development Dropbox internship that will happen next
  year.
  I cannot wait to finish my degree and show the world what I can do.

<p>Why Web Development? As a little kid, I was fascinated by computers. When I was 11 years old, my dad brought 2 old computers
  he was given to our home, they did not work so my siblings and I had this crazy idea about building out a new one from those 2 computers and so we did. 
  After 2 or 4 months we finally were able to get to work one of them by adding extra parts that were needed for it to work.
  It's alive! ‚ò†Ô∏èüî©‚ö°Ô∏èüßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I was so happy to see it work that we decided to test it out with a video game that night.
  I kept learning how to use a computer and its applications and kept thinking that someday I would be one of those engineers that built 
  those programs or applications to make the computer work. 
  This is where I am now, on this path to becoming a recognized software developer...
